# Documentation for the tags


## Image Types

| tag | description |
|-----|-------------|
| duplicate | a (close) duplicate of another image; only counted if in the same search (same search source and text!), the number after the colon is the lowest number of the image that was not tagged as duplicate |
| ignore | image that should be excluded completely (e.g. off topic or no discernible content) |
| unknown | automatically assigned to untagged images |
| advert | something that can be used as an advert for a blockchain service/software |
| architecture diagram | a diagram for a software architecture that has a similar style to an uml diagram |
| artistic | an artistic representation of a blockchain |
| book cover | a book cover |
| deployment diagram | a diagram that shows how/where different parts of a software are deployed |
| flowchart | a decision graph in diagram form |
| infographic | any informative graphic with explaining text |


## Image Elements

| tag | description |
|-----|-------------|
| abandoned blocks | blocks that were abandoned as they are not part of the longest active chain |
| actors | human actors |
| block verification | something symbolising that the block is verified/can be trusted |
| blockchain | a whole blockchain as an entity; just the word blockchain with a network of nodes in the picture does not qualify the image for this tag (this should exclude advert type images that pass this more by chance than by consideration) |
| blocks | a block of a blockchain (multiple blocks are not counted); if it is not clear if something is a block or a node both tags can be used |
| extra links | extra links between blocks that are not needed for correct functionality |
| link verification | something symbolising that the link between two blocks is verified/can be trusted |
| links | a link between two blocks of a blockchain (may not have a graphical representation itself but is expressed by how blocks interact with each other [example: puzzle pieces]) |
| literal chain | a literal chain that resembles a physical chain |
| miners | a cryptocurrency miner |
| node links | a link between two (network-) nodes |
| nodes | a node in a computer network; if it is not clear if something is a block or a node both tags can be used |
| origin block | the very first block in a blockchain |
| smart contracts | a smart contract |
| transaction verification | something symbolising that the block is verified/can be trusted/is forever part of the blockchain |
| transactions | a transaction of money or data with the/over the blockchain |
| wallet | a wallet for storing cryptocurrency |


## Element Specifics

The element specifics describe parts of the visual representation of a image element. This can be a shape (like rectangle, circle or hexagon), a variation of a shape (like rounded corners for a rectangle) or some other part of the visual representation like an icon or a symbol.
